learning to use github
Hi, my name is Gong Zhang. I'm learning programming.
I'm a master in Electrical Engineering but I can't find a job in that field
Maybe I need to make myself more competitive, so I started learning c++ about six months ago.
And I heard programmers should know how to use GitHub.
So, here I come.
